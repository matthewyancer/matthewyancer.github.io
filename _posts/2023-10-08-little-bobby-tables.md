## Little Bobby Tables

Here's a great comic touching on injection attacks, from XKCD:

I always use this comic to kick off discussions with young developers on security vulnerabilities.

The next stop is looking at the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), which is currently (as of the 2021 update):

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

It's hard to believe that for my entire career, Injection has been in the top ten. At least it has moved down to #3 from the #1 slot in the previous revision. If you are a software developer and you are not familiar with this list and how to prevent these vulnerabilities, it is worth your time to review it.

Here's a listing of [30 tips for software developers to enhance software security](https://codesigningstore.com/tips-for-software-developers-to-enhance-software-security) which touches on some good topics.

And this is just the beginning. What are some software development security best practices that you follow?
