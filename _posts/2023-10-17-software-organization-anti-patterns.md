## Software Organization Anti-Patterns

Time for another round-up of [anti-patterns](https://www.matthewyancer.com/2023/10/09/architecture-anti-patterns.html), this time focusing on software organization anti-patterns. As much as developers may want to focus on writing code, it's not uncommon to have to wade through an organization's own re-enactment of [*Game of Thrones*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiChenab_XI). It's useful to have an awareness of [common](https://effectivemanagers.com/dwight-mihalicz/the-top-12-fallacies-that-get-in-the-way-of-organizational-performance-part-1/) [fallacies](https://effectivemanagers.com/dwight-mihalicz/the-top-12-fallacies-that-get-in-the-way-of-organizational-performance-part-2/), [political games](https://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/games/mintzberg_game.htm), and [groupthink](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/blog/how-can-groupthink-affect-your-organization/) to better navigate an organization. And I would encourage managers to identify these anti-patterns early and snuff them out so that the true objectives of the organization can get the attention that they need.

Christoph Nissle has a great write-up on twelve software organization anti-patterns in his post [here](https://medium.com/@christophnissle/anti-patterns-in-software-organisations-6a4fc3073a2b):

- Body Ballooning
- Empire Building
- Warm Body
- Single Head of Knowledge
- Mushroom Management
- Yet Another Meeting Will Solve It
- Net Negative Producing Programmer
- Management By Numbers
- Fear of Success
- Faux System Architects
- Crocodile Management
- Programmer Interrupt

Software organizations can also be impacted by general organizational anti-patterns that would affect any organization. Noah Brier has a summary of seven of these types of patterns [here](https://www.variance.com/posts/organizational-antipatterns):

- Anlaysis Paralysis
- Bicycle Shed
- Cash Cow
- Design by Committee
- Peter Principle
- Seagull Management
- Stovepipe or Silos

David Tanzer covers a list of nine anti-patterns common to agile organizations in his book, [*Quick Glance At: Agile Anti-Patterns*](https://www.amazon.com/Quick-Glance-At-Agile-Anti-Patterns/dp/1980226318). Jose M. Beas has a summary of these in his three-part series [here](https://community.taiga.io/t/9-anti-patterns-damaging-your-team-and-how-to-avoid-them-i/362), [here](https://community.taiga.io/t/9-anti-patterns-damaging-your-team-and-how-to-avoid-them-part-ii/416), and [here](https://community.taiga.io/t/9-anti-patterns-damaging-your-team-and-how-to-avoid-them-part-iii/429):

- Agile Theater
- Feature Factory
- Product Backlog Bankruptcy
- Team Backlog
- Architecture Breakdown
- Burnout by 1000 Baby Steps

Are there any organization anti-patterns you would add to the list?
