## SOLID Principles

One of the foundational topics I cover when onboarding new developers is Robert C. Martin's (aka Uncle Bob's) SOLID design principles.

The SOLID principles are:  
- The **S**ingle-responsibility principle -- "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."
- The **O**pen-closed principle -- "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The **L**iskov substitution principle -- "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
- The **I**nterface segregation principle -- "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- The **D**ependency inversion principle -- "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."

Uncle Bob thoroughly covers the topic in Scott Hanselman's Hanselminutes podcast episodes 145 and 150:  
- [Hanselminutes Episode 145: SOLID Principles with Uncle Bob - Robert C. Martin](https://hanselminutes.com/145/solid-principles-with-uncle-bob-robert-c-martin)
- [Hanselminutes Episode 150: Uncle Bob Martin: SOLID, this time with feeling](https://hanselminutes.com/150/uncle-bob-martin-solid-this-time-with-feeling)

Joey deVilla has a [comprehensive listing of SOLID related materials on his blog, Global Nerdy](https://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/07/15/the-solid-principles-explained-with-motivational-posters/). He also includes a set of delightful motivational posters for each of the principles that I think really help drive home the meaning of each. Worth a look.

What do you think -- are the SOLID principles still relevant today?
