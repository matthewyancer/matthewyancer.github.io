## The Agile Manifesto, Part 1: Introduction

In this series, I'll be exploring the [Agile 'Software Development' Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) created by the [17 members of the Agile Alliance during a conference in Snowbird, Utah from February 11-13, 2001](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html).

The Agile Manifesto has six sections:

1. **Title**: The choice of the word *manifesto* is an interesting one, implying a need for changes in how software was developed at that time. And the word *agile* suggests quickness, flexibility, and responsiveness to changing requirements.

2. **Preamble**: An introductory statement setting forth the goal of improving software development through a set of values.

3. **Values**: Describes four values for how software should be created by contrasting them with four other values. (In follow-up posts, I will be exploring each of the values contained in the Agile Manifesto.)

4. **Clarification**: Modifies the values section by stating the preference for certain values over the contrasting values but not fully negating the contrasting values.

5. **Authors**: Provides a listing of the [17 members of the Agile Alliance](https://agilemanifesto.org/authors.html), [a *Who's Who* of software development experts](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/agile-manifesto/#:~:text=Who%20Created%20the%20Agile%20Manifesto%3F). Including representatives from various different (and, in some cases, competing) agile practicing groups:

   * [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module)
   * [DSDM](https://www.agilebusiness.org/business-agility/what-is-dsdm.html)
   * [Adaptive Software Development (ASD)](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/adaptive-software-development)
   * [Crystal Agile Methodology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crystal-methods-in-agile-development-framework/)
   * [Feature-Driven Development](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/why-use-feature-driven-development)
   * [Pragmatic Programming](https://wiki.c2.com/?PragmaticProgrammer)

6. **License**: A permissive license for using the Agile Manifesto.
