## Architecture Anti-Patterns

In the realm of software development, *design patterns* are common approaches to common problems that have been formalized and are generally considered good development practices. In contrast, there are certain patterns that are considered bad programming practices, or *anti-patterns*. They may seem justifiable at first, but result in a bad solution with consequences.

As I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.matthewyancer.com/2023/10/04/code-reviews.html), code reading  is an important skill. Being familiar with architecture anti-patterns can improve understanding should you encounter one during a code review. It's also important when designing or extending a system to make sure that you are not falling into a common trap.

One of the first documented architecture anti-patterns is the *Big Ball of Mud*, a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. There can be various reasons for this: lack of experience on the developer team, staff turnover, business pressures, code entropy over time, etc. These systems are difficult to maintain and extend.

The *Big Ball of Mud* was covered along with six other patterns in a [1997 paper by Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder on architecture anti-patterns](http://www.laputan.org/mud/). The seven anti-patterns covered in this paper are:

- Big Ball of Mud
- Throwaway Code
- Piecemeal Growth
- Keep it Working
- Shearing Layers
- Sweeping it Under the Rug
- Reconstruction

Jeff Atwood also has a good [summary of this paper on Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-big-ball-of-mud-and-other-architectural-disasters/amp/).

There's another great list of [thirteen architecture anti-patterns on sourcemaking.com](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/software-architecture-antipatterns). The first page summarizes the anti-patterns. Then there is a separate page describing each after that. These thirteen anti-patterns are: 

- Autogenerated Stovepipe
- Stovepipe Enterprise
- Jumble
- Stovepipe System
- Cover Your Assets
- Vendor Lock-In
- Wolf Ticket
- Architecture by Implication
- Warm Bodies
- Design by Committee
- Swiss Army Knife
- Reinvent the Wheel
- The Grand Old Duke of York

Finally, Christoph Nissle has coverage for [five additional architecture anti-patterns](https://medium.com/@christophnissle/anti-patterns-in-software-architecture-3c8970c9c4f5). The five anti-patterns are:

- Gas Factory
- Inner Platform Effect
- Spaghetti Code
- Sumo Marriage
- Integration Databases

Which of these have you encountered?
